# SkyScanner: The Perfect Reunion - HackUPC 2025 Challenge Submission

This repository contains the code for our web platform, "SkyScanner: The Perfect Reunion," developed for the Skyscanner challenge at the HackUPC 2025 hackathon.

Our platform aims to solve the age-old problem of coordinating a meetup for friends scattered across the globe. We provide a user-friendly and fun, collaborative experience where groups can easily discover the ideal destination for their reunion.

**Key Features:**

* **Group Formation:** Simple creation of groups and easy invitation of members.
* **Individual Preference Setting:** Each member can specify their ideal travel preferences across various parameters like country, weather, activities, budget, green travel considerations, and interest in local events.
* **Round-Based Suggestion & Voting:** Destination options are presented round by round, focusing on a single parameter at a time. Members use a familiar "swipe left/right" interface to vote on each option.
* **Intelligent Recommendation Engine:** Our backend integrates with various APIs (flights, weather, points of interest, events) to generate relevant destination suggestions based on the group's collective preferences.
* **Collaborative Decision-Making:** Real-time voting updates and potential chat functionality to facilitate discussion and consensus building within the group.

**This project leverages:** 

* **Frontend:** [React, HTML/CSS/JavaScript]
* **Backend:** [Node.js/Express]
* **Database:** [PostgreSQL, MongoDB]
* **APIs:** [Skyscanner API, OpenWeatherMap API, Google Places API]
